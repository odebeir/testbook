There are two ways to read *Introduction to image processing*:

* The *recommended* way to read the book is to download and run the jupyter notebooks interactively. You can do this by cloning the GitHub repository, installing the package and its dependencies, and running the notebooks interactively. Instructions for doing this are provided below in the **Installation** section.

* The *easiest* way to read the book is to view the static notebooks online.

If you're new to the jupyter Notebook, you can find more information at the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/).

If you're going to read the book interactively (recommended), you'll need to clone this repository, install some dependencies, and launch the jupyter notebook. For example, the following commands should work for Linux and Mac OS X users:

    anaconda distribution should do the job
    conda install scikit-image 

Finally, launch the jupyter Notebook to get started (be sure that you're in the ``Introduction to image processing`` directory when you run this command):
