================================

TOC should be updated from .ipynb

How to read the content
-----------------------

There are two ways to read *Introduction to image processing*:

* The *recommended* way to read the book is to download and run the IPython notebooks interactively. You can do this by cloning the GitHub repository, installing the package and its dependencies, and running the notebooks interactively. Instructions for doing this are provided below in the **Installation** section.

* The *easiest* way to read the book is to view the static notebooks online using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). You should [start here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/odebeir/info-h-500-501/blob/master/Index.ipynb).

If you're new to using IPython or the IPython Notebook, you can find more information at the [IPython website](http://www.ipython.org/), [IPython Notebook website](http://ipython.org/notebook), and the [IPython Notebook example gallery](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).

Installation
------------

If you're going to read the book interactively (recommended), you'll need to clone this repository, install some dependencies, and launch the IPython Notebook. For example, the following commands should work for Linux and Mac OS X users:

    anaconda distribution should do the job
    conda install scikit-image 

Finally, launch the IPython Notebook to get started (be sure that you're in the ``Introduction to image processing`` directory when you run this command):

    ipython notebook --pylab inline Index.ipynb

That's it!
